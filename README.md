# Advent of Code 2021 - My Answers

The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a programming puzzle challenge that gives participants two coding challenges each day during the month of December. This repository holds my submission/answers for these challenges. I am going to try and do all of them in bash, because I hate myself. Enjoy.

## Usage

You can `export DEBUG=1` to see more information as each challenge script is executed.

```bash
make seed
make run
```
